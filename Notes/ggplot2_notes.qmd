## 1: Introduction

> ggplot2 is designed to work iteratively
>
> the grammar tells us that a graphic maps the data to the aesthetic attributes (colour, shape, size) of geometric objects (points, lines, bars)

## 2: First steps

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
mpg
```

> Every ggplot2 plot has three key components:
>
> 1.  **data**,
>
> 2.  A set of **aesthetic mappings** between variables in the data and visual properties, and
>
> 3.  At least one layer which describes how to render each observation. Layers are usually created with a **geom** function.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point()
```
