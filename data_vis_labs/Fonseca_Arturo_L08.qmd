## Overview

The goal of this lab is to use an alternative coordinate system in `ggplot2` to build a plot. 

## Dataset

We'll be using the `mod_nba_adv_stats_2023_24.txt` dataset --- add to your project's `/data` subdirectory. The `mod_nba_adv_stats_2023_24_codebook.txt` provides a quick description of the variables in the dataset --- suggest adding it to the `/data` subdirectory as well. 

```{r}
#| label: load-pkgs-data

# load package(s)

# load data

```

## Exercise 

<!-- See the html instructions since they are complete with images and are the official instructions. -->

Using the `mod_nba_adv_stats_2023_24.txt` dataset we will try to recreate/approximate the plot type featured in the [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/) article [Kawhi Leonard Is The Most Well-Rounded Elite Shooter Since Larry Bird](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kawhi-leonard-is-the-most-well-rounded-elite-shooter-since-larry-bird/) for any player of your choice for the 2023-2024 season.

## Goal

Replicate the graphic below as closely as possible --- see instructions for image.

### Start with data wrangling

When data wrangling we will need a helper function for creating the quartiles for players. Additionally, it will be useful to exclude players that played less than 10 games or played less than 5 minutes a game. That is, we only want to include "qualified" players.

```{r}
#| label: helper-function
#| eval: false

# Returns quartile rank
quartile_rank <- function(x = 0:99) {
  # Set quartile
  quart_breaks <- c(
    -Inf,
    quantile(x,
      probs = c(.25, .5, .75),
      na.rm = TRUE
    ),
    Inf
  )
  cut(x = x, breaks = quart_breaks, labels = FALSE)
}
```

:::{.callout-important}
**Add comments to** the code below where indicated. The added comments should concisely describe what the following line(s) of code do in the data wrangling process

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}

## Solution

```{r}
#| label: data-wrangling
#| eval: false

# Graphical data
nba_graph_dat <- nba_dat |> 
  # ADD COMMENT !!!!
  filter(g >= 10, mp / g >= 5) |> 
  # ADD COMMENT !!!!
  mutate(
    ts_quant = quartile_rank(ts_percent),
    trb_quant = quartile_rank(trb_percent),
    dbpm_quant = quartile_rank(dbpm),
    ast_quant = quartile_rank(ast_percent),
    usg_quant = quartile_rank(usg_percent)
  ) |> 
  # ADD COMMENT !!!!
  select(player, contains("_quant")) |> 
  # ADD COMMENT !!!!
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -player, 
    names_to = "variable", 
    values_to = "value"
    ) |> 
  # ADD COMMENT !!!!
  arrange(player)
```

### Build the plot

*Hints:*

- Image width is 8 in, height is 10 in --- use code chunk yaml
- center the image output --- use code chunk yaml
- shrink size down for display to 50% width --- use code chunk yaml
- All added text, except title, is done with `annotate()`
- set `axis.text` to blank in theme
- size 3 and 5 could be useful

## Challenge

:::{.callout-important icon=false}

Challenge is optional for all students, but we recommend trying them out!

<!-- See the html instructions since they are complete with images and are the official instructions. -->

Continue the work of trying to recreate the graphic from the article. Your final plot should look as follows:
