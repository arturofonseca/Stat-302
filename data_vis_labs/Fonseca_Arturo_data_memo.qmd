## Instructions

After selecting data for the final project write up a short memo that at minimum covers the following:

### Data source

Identify and describe your data source or sources --- citations would be appropriate. Citations will typically include links to the data source.

### Why this data

The reason for your choice of data. Is it interesting to you? Challenging? Is this part of a larger research project? State any questions of interest that might be motivating your choice of data. Include any other motivations or background that you believe to be relevant.

In general, we are asking you to tell us what sorts of questions you are trying to answer or what story you are trying to convey. Maybe you are just exploring a topic that is interesting to you and you are prospecting for a story to tell and that is okay too.

### Visualization plan

Share your plan for visualizing the data. Are you going with a presentation and static graphics, presentation with a mix animated and static graphics, or will you attempt to build an app/dashboard? 

This is just an initial plan and you don't have to stick to it.

### Initial data issues

Have you been able to download the data and read it into R? If not, where are you getting stuck?

Have you been able to examine the data a little? If yes, have you spotted any potential issues like difficult data wrangling or data quality issues such as a significant amount of missing data?

### Misc

Students are encourage to add any other information that they think would be useful to communicate about their data and their plan.

If are seeking permission to work with a partner or partners then you should indicate it at the top of this memo (add a new section). Should include how you plan to work together or why working together makes sense for the project.
