## Overview

The goal of this lab is to explore methods for annotating and positioning with `ggplot2` plots. This lab also utilizes `scale_*` to a greater degree which is part of our next reading. In fact, students may find going through/reading chapter [11 Colour scales and legends](https://ggplot2-book.org/scale-colour.html) useful.

## Datasets

We'll be using the `blue_jays.rda`, `titanic.rda`, `Aus_athletes.rda`, and `tech_stocks.rda` datasets.

```{r}
#| label: load-pkgs-data

# Load package(s)

# Load data

```

## Exercises

Complete the following exercises.

## Exercise 1

Using the `blue_jays.rda` dataset, recreate the following graphic as precisely as possible.

*Hints:*

- Transparency is 0.8
- Point size 2
- Create a `label_info` dataset that is a subset of original data, just with the 2 birds to be labeled
- Shift label text horizontally by 0.5
- See ggplot2 textbook 8.3 building custom annotations 
- Annotation size is 4
- Classic theme

## Exercise 2

Using the `tech_stocks` dataset, recreate the following graphics as precisely as possible. Use the column `price_indexed`.

### Plot 1

*Hints:*

- Create a `label_info` dataset that is a subset of original data, just containing the last day's information for each of the 4 stocks
- serif font
- Annotation size is 4

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Solution

:::

### Plot 2

*Hints:*

- Package `ggrepel`
  - `box.padding` is 0.6
  - Minimum segment length is 0 
  - Horizontal justification is to the right
  - seed of 9876
- Annotation size is 4
- serif font

## Exercise 3

Using the `titanic.rda` dataset, recreate the following graphic as precisely as possible.

*Hints:*

- Create a new variable that uses `died` and `survived` as levels/categories
- Hex colors: `#D55E00D0`, `#0072B2D0` (no alpha is being used)

## Exercise 4

Use the `athletes_dat` dataset --- extracted from `Aus_althetes.rda` --- to recreate the following graphic as precisely as possible. **Create the graphic twice**: once using `patchwork` and once using `cowplot`.

```{r}
#| label: ex-4-data-wrangle
#| eval: false 

# Get list of sports played by BOTH sexes
both_sports <- Aus_athletes |>
  # dataset of columns sex and sport 
  # only unique observations
  distinct(sex, sport) |>
  # see if sport is played by one gender or both
  count(sport) |>
  # only want sports played by BOTH sexes
  filter(n == 2) |>
  # get list of sports
  pull(sport)

# Process data
athletes_dat <- Aus_athletes |>
  # only keep sports played by BOTH sexes
  filter(sport %in% both_sports) |>
  # rename track (400m) and track (sprint) to be track
  # case_when will be very useful with shiny apps
  mutate(
    sport = case_when(
      sport == "track (400m)" ~ "track",
      sport == "track (sprint)" ~ "track",
      TRUE ~ sport
      )
    )
```

*Hints:*

- Build each plot separately
- Bar plot: lower limit 0, upper limit 95
- Bar plot: shift bar labels by 5 units and top justify 
- Bar plot: label size is 5
- Bar plot: `#D55E00D0` & `#0072B2D0` --- no `alpha`
- Scatterplot: `#D55E00D0` & `#0072B2D0` --- no `alpha`
- Scatterplot: filled circle with "white" outline; size is 3
- Scatterplot: `rcc` is red blood cell count; `wcc` is white blood cell count
- Boxplot: outline `#D55E00` and `#0072B2`; shading `#D55E0040` and `#0072B240`
- Boxplot: should be made narrower; 0.5
- Boxplot: Legend is in top-right corner of bottom plot
- Boxplot: Space out labels `c("female    ", "male")`
- Boxplot: Legend shading matches hex values for top two plots

### Using `patchwork`

### Using `cowplot`

Use [`cowplot::plot_grid()`](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/articles/plot_grid.html) to combine them.

## Exercise 5

Create the following graphic using `patchwork`.

*Hints:*

- Use plots created in Exercise 4
- inset theme is classic
  - Useful values: 0, 0.45, 0.75, 1
- plot annotation `"A"`
